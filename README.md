# Machine-Learning

1. Importing dataset
2. Modelling
3. Evaluation

## Feature Scaling
- Applied to columns only
- To scale all the values in a particular range so that they become comparable
- Feature scaling should be applied after the splitting the dataset into training and test set because the test set is supposed to be a brand new set.( the test set should be fresh)

1. Normalization
2. Standardization


## Features and Dependent variables

- Features are the independent variables (x)
- Dependent variables are mostly present in the last column (y)
